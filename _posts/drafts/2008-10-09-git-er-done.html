If you've been in development for any significant length of time, you've run into source control systems, like <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/products/starteam/index.html">Starteam</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vs2005/aa718670.aspx">Visual Source Safe</a>, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>, or <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion (SVN)</a>. Maybe you've even used one or two.

There's a new trend in source control called "distributed source control". Traditionally, you have a single central server that houses all your code, manages synchronization, and the like. However, new source control systems like <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> are taking a different approach - there is no single repository. Instead, every developer in the project runs their own repository, which they may allow others to pull code from. It's a little confusing at first, but far more flexible once you get into it.

You've may have heard of git, but how do you practically use it? It's easy! Once installed, you have a few basic commands you might be interested in.

<h3>git init</h3>
`git init` creates a new repository in your current working directory. For example:

Let's say I have an empty directory, and want to create a git repository out of it. I just `git init` and we're ready to start committing code.

<h3>git add</h3>
Now that we have a repository, how do we use it? It's easy.

Let's add a file to the directory - call it README - and put "Hello, Version 1" in it. Save it, and next, we'll add it to our git repository.

<pre>`git add README`</pre>


<h3>git clone</h3>

`git clone` allows you to <i>clone</i> another existing repository. Let's say you want to get a copy of my <a href="http://github.com/cheald/site_config/tree/master">site_config</a> Rails plugin. All you'd have to do is <i>clone</i> the URL that github gives you:

<pre>`git clone git://github.com/cheald/site_config.git`</pre>

Once the command completes, you'll have a brand-new `site_config` directory, with the project files inside of it.
