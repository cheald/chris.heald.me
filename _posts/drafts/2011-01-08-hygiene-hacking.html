This is entirely non-programming-related, but it is very much in line with the hacker ethos - experiment, question assumptions, apply logic, etc. If you're just here for the code, you might want to skip to the next post.

For a couple of years now, I've been shaving without shaving cream - and it's great. There are a few tricks to it, but I get a cleaner, smoother, less irritating shave than I did before. The logic behind it is simple - the purpose of shaving cream is, primarily, to trap heat next to the skin, and to warm it up, making it more pliable and elastic. It doesn't magically prevent cuts or help you shave closer - if anything, the cream gets between the blade and the skin and hinders the shave. Instead, I just spend about 30-45 seconds with my stubble in very hot shower water, until it loosens up and starts to feel "fuzzy" rather than "coarse". Be sure to use a sharp, quality razor (the Mach 3 is my choice) - just never use a disposable or similar low-quality blade. At that point, shave as normal, and you'll find that it's closer and less irritating to your skin overall.

That was my first foray into hygiene hacking - I'd always assumed that you needed shaving cream, because that's what the guys who shaved used. I was surprised that it worked, but lo and behold, it did. So, with that in mind, I am perhaps a little more open to other similar hygiene hacks. When I read about
