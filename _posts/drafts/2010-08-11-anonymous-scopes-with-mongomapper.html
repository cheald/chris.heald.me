I'm using MongoMapper as my Rails ORM in my current project, and it's worked out really well so far. It has <em>most</em> of the features that I know and love from ActiveRecord, and where they aren't there, it's usually not too bad to add them.

I needed anonymous scopes today. Named scopes are really nice and all, and they're easy to add, but anonymous scopes can make things really nice and sexy. Fortunately, they're really easy to patch in:

`lib/mongo_mapper/anonymous_scopes.rb`
~~~ruby
module MongoMapper
	module AnonymousScopes
		def scoped(by = {})		
			query.scoped(by)
		end
	end
end

module Plucky
	class Query
		def scoped(by = {})
			merge(where(by))
		end
	end
end
~~~

Now, in your model, just extend the class with it:

class User
  extend MongoMapper::AnonymousScopes
end
