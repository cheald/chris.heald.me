I'm sure you've heard by now that SOPA is bad and would ruin the internet, but have you actually read the bill? If not, it's worth reading, for two reasons. First, if you are going to oppose a bill, you should know exactly what you're opposing, not just the vague principle behind it. Second, it'll provide you with some valuable insight into the way these bills are written in an attempt to obscure the truth.

First off, I'm going to qualify that I'm not a lawyer, but I am a programmer, and that's made me pretty good at unraveling spaghetti code. If ever a bill was spaghetti, this is it.

<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c112:./temp/~c112y1HR5Z">Here is the full text of the bill</a> as of Jan 15, 2012. Open a copy of it, because we'll be referring to it

The really scary part of the bill is in section 103. It is titled "MARKET-BASED SYSTEM TO PROTECT U.S. CUSTOMERS AND PREVENT U.S. FUNDING OF SITES DEDICATED TO THEFT OF U.S. PROPERTY.". On a first reading, it doesn't sound that scary. Read through section A1.
